Ucrypt will be a command line program which allows the user to encrypt and decrypt files as well as data entered via standard in using the 128 bit version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. The key which is used to encrypt/decrypt a file can then be encrypted/decrypted using the Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm. The public and private RSA keys which are generated will be encrypted using the Base64 encryption scheme. Together, RSA and AES represent the two most widely used and most secure cryptographical algorithms to date.
